# UnitySphinx

This project is meant as an example of integrating and using [Pocketsphinx](https://github.com/cmusphinx/pocketsphinx) from Unity3d. Right now it incorporates pre-built binaries for Windows (64-bit),
and an English (US) statistical model and dictionary.

- TODO: better documentation, more usage examples, more platforms, etc.
